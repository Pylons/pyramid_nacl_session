This Pyramid add-on defines an encrypting, pickle-based cookie serializer, using `PyNaCl <https://pynacl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/secret/>`_ to generate the symmetric encryption for the cookie state.

See https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid-nacl-session/en/latest/ for the documentation.
